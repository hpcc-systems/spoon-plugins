Before first building spoon-plugins you must execute either
run-once.sh (Linux/Unix) or  run-once.bat (Windows) to add
Eclipse SWT libraries and metadata. 

To build a "drop-in" zip file to using in Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle):

1. From the spoon-plugins directory (the project root), run the following 
   command to build the individual project components:    
   
   mvn install

2. Upon successful execution of the previous step, run the following command
   to create the distributable zip file: 
   
   mvn -f plugin-distribution/pom.xml install
   
3. Upon successful execution the file "spoon-plugins-distribution.zip" will be
   found in the plugin-distribution/target directory.

4. To install in Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle), unzip the above file into
   the "data-integration/plugins" directory of the Kettle installation.
   
5. The directory structure of Kettle should look like this:
   data-integration/
       /plugins
           /spoon 
               /eclresults
                   eclresults.jar
           /hpcc-common
               ecldirect.jar
               eclgui.jar
       /jobentries
           /ecldataset
               ecldataset.jar
           /ecldedup
               ecldedup.jar
           ...   

6. If the installation is successful delete the zip file from the Kettle
   installation.
